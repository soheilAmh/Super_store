# Super store Analysis Project (A Quera bootcamp project)
In the first phase of this project we got a store's dataset (sales, shipment, customers, products ...), after preprocessing and data cleaning we designed a data warehouse which includes fact and dimension tables and follows a STAR structure, ofcourse this design includes PKs, FKs and the relationship between the tables, then we imported these in PowerBI to ensure correctness of the steps we took.

In phase 2 we divided our products into two tables, 'Discounted' & 'UnDiscounted', we visualized, observed relationships and found trends between some features, and finally examined wheter discount on items affects the total amount of sales and concludes in more profit or not.

Companies want to predict the future and control their work flow in the best possible waay for the desireable outcome, so In phase 3 we picked the most impactful and effective features, trained our dataset (80/20) with XGBoost and Random forest models to predict the 'profit' and 'Ship Mode'.

and in the last phase we reported our findings in previous phases, answered some frequent and important questions, and created dashboards for them in PowerBI
